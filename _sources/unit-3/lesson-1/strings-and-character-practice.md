# Strings and Characters Practice

`Download starter code`

This question is to assess your understanding of how to work with `String` variables and `for` loops.

Write code that takes a String `message` and a character `letter` and counts the number of times `letter` occurs within `message` and prints that result to the console.

For example, if `message` holds `"Hello"` and `letter` holds `l`, your program should produce the output `2` because there are two occurrences of `l` in the String `Hello`.
