# Nested For Loops Review Problem

`Download starter code`
These questions are to assess your understanding of how to effectively use nested for loops.

Finish the program by adding a nested for loop that helps produce the following output:

```java
#------------------------------#
#                              #
#                              #
#                              #
#------------------------------#
```

The table below gives us the amount of characters we are printing on each of the five lines:

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
*   - Line #
    - \# of Spaces
    - \# of Dashes
*   - 1
    - 0
    - 30
*   - 2
    - 30
    - 0
*   - 3
    - 30
    - 0
*   - 4
    - 30
    - 0
*   - 5
    - 0
    - 30

:::{admonition} Note
:class: note
Note that we are only paying attention to how many spaces or dashes are on each line. We don't need to create a column for the pound sign/hashtag since we are only printing it once at the beginning and end of the lines.
