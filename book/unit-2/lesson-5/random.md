Above, you'll see there's a video titled ***CSE 121: Random Video Walkthrough***. The video and the reading both have the same information! You're not required to go through both the video and the reading, as the video just walks through the reading to help contextualize it!
:::

The concept of **randomness** is pretty useful in the real world! Sometimes, we want to be able to generate some random value and use it somehow. We could use random values to draw a random amount of stars, or print a message some random amount of times, etc.

There are a lot of uses for generating random values, and luckily we have a way to mimic randomness in Java‚Äîthis section will discuss using `Random` in Java and how to use it to generate ranges of random values!

## `Random` in Java üé≤

As mentioned previously, `Random` can be used in Java to generate *pseudorandom* numbers.

Note: `Random` is just like `Turtle`s , however instead of using them to draw pictures, we use them to generate an arbitrary range of random values. Just like how we can make the `Turtle` do particular things (i.e. "move") by making calls to particular methods, we can use methods on `Random` to generate those values.

## Creating `Random` ‚úèÔ∏è 

In order to use `Random`, we have to be able to create (or construct) it!

:::{admonition} Caution
:class: caution

In order to successfully construct and use `Random` in our programs, make sure you have **`import java.util.*;`** at the very top of your program!
:::

!["Random" (highlighted in blue) "rand" (highlighted in yellow) "= new Random();" (highlighted in pink).](images/random-creation.png)

1. **The type** ‚Äì just like with any variable, when you create it you want to make clear what type the variable is. We can have variables of type `Random` by making sure you list the type as `Random`.

2. **The name** ‚Äì again, just like with any variables, we can name `Random` variables anything we want! You'll usually see them being named something along the lines of `rand`, `r`, etc. but it's up to you what you'd like to name it ‚Äì as long as the name is clear, concise, and follows prescribed naming conventions.

3. **`Random` creation code** ‚Äì to **construct** or create a new `Random` variable, you **must** have `new Random();` after the equal sign when creating a `Random` variable. This code helps ensure that we are properly constructing a new `Random` variable. Note that `new` is a keyword needed to create an instance of `Random`!


Check out the block of code! If you try to run it, we get a compiler error.

Try fixing the code so that it runs properly. (answer is located in the *Expand* block below the code)
:::

``` Java
import java.util.*; // make sure to have this whenever you are using Random

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // code below to create a new Random variable

        // something is wrong with it! try editing it so that this 
        // properly creates a Random object
        Random rand = Random();
    }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Expand</summary>

Remember that in order to correctly create Random, we must have everything in the line below:

`Random rand = new Random();`

In the code above, we forgot the `new` keyword on the right side of the equal sign on line 9.

</details>

## `Random` Methods üßÆ 

Now that we know how to construct `Random`, we should learn how to use it to generate a random range of values!

First off, we need to learn about the different methods we can call on our `Random` variables:

- `nextInt()` ‚Äì when called on a `Random`, this method call will give you back any random `int`.

- `nextInt(int max)` ‚Äì when called on a `Random`, this method call will give you back any random `int` in the range starting at `0` and ending at `max - 1`. This range excludes the `max` value that is placed in between the parentheses.

  - As an example, if I called `nextInt(10)`, there is an equally likely probability that I'll get any value starting with `0` and ending at `9` (does **not** include `10`).

- `nextDouble()` ‚Äì when called on a `Random`, this method call will give you back any random `double` between `0.0` and `1.0` (exclusive).


Run the code below to see how we can use these methods:

Try running the code block multiple times to see how these values change!
:::

``` Java
import java.util.*; // make sure to have this whenever you are using Random

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // code below to create a new Random variable
        Random rand = new Random();

        // generating a random value as an int
        int randInt = rand.nextInt();
        System.out.println("value from call to nextInt(): " + randInt);

        // generating a random value as an int between 0 and 10 (exclusive)
        int randIntRange = rand.nextInt(10);
        System.out.println("value from call to nextInt(10): " + randIntRange);

        // generating a random value as a double
        double randDouble = rand.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("value from call to nextDouble(): " + randDouble);
    }
}
```

## Generating an Arbitrary Range of Values üìö 

Notice that when calling `nextInt(int max)`, we get a range that will always start at `0` (called **zero-inclusive**) and will end right just before `max` (called **max-exclusive**). 

But what if we want to generate a random value from a range that starts at 1 and ends exactly at `max`? Or what if I wanted a range that starts at 5 and ends at 15?

We can generate any random range of values we want using a call to `nextInt(int max)` and manipulating these values slightly.

For example, to get a random number from 1 to `max` inclusive, all we have to do is add 1 to the call to `nextInt()` and this will shift the range of random values ranging between 0 and `max - 1` to between 1 and `max`:

``` Java
// generating a value in the range of 1 to max
int num = rand.nextInt(max) + 1;
```

If you wanted to generate a value in any range where you know the minimum (`min`) value and the maximum (`max`) value, you can use the following template:

``` Java
// generating a value in the range of min to max
int num = rand.nextInt(range) + min; // where range = max - min + 1
```

Another example, to get a random integer in the range of 4 to 10 inclusive:

``` Java
// min = 4
// max = 10
// range = max - min + 1 = 10 - 4 + 1 = 7
int num = rand.nextInt(7) + 4;
```

## Main Points:

- In Java, the `Random` class is used to generate pseudorandom numbers.

- To use `Random`, `import java.util.*` and create a new instance of `Random` with the syntax `Random rand = new Random();`.

- The `Random` class has methods like `nextInt()` (returns any random `int`), `nextInt(int max)` (returns a random `int` in the range 0 to `max-1`), and `nextDouble()` (returns any random double between `0.0` and `1.0` exclusive).

- To generate an arbitrary range of values starting from `min` to `max`, use the formula `int num = rand.nextInt(range) + min;`, where `range = max - min + 1`.
