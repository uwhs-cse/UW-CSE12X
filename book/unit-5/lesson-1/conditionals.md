Above, you'll see there's a video titled **CSE 121: Conditionals Video Walkthrough**. The video and the reading both have the same information! You're not required to go through both the video and the reading, as the video just walks through the reading to help contextualize it!

## ðŸ§  Motivation

Say that I wanted to write a method that would take in an integer and print whether that number was positive or negative to the console.

If the parameter of the method was `4`, then I would want to print `4 is positive!` or if the parameter of the method was `-200`, the I would want to print `-200 is negative!`.

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        determinePosOrNeg(4); // should tell us "4 is positive!"
        determinePosOrNeg(-200); // should tell us "-200 is negative!"
        int num2 = -200;
    }

    public static void determinePosOrNeg(int num) {
        // if the number is positive, i want to print it's positive
        // if its negative, i want to print it's negative
    }
}
```

Notice that I want to output one message *if* the parameter is positive and I want to output a different message *if* the parameter is negative.

We actually don't have a way to implement the behavior of the method below with only the concepts we've learned about so far. This is where **conditionals** will come in handy!

## ðŸ’­ `if` statement

The **`if`** statement is the building block of conditionals! It allows us to execute a certain body of statements if a test passes. If the test fails, then we execute whatever statements come after the conditional.

The `if` statement contains the following syntax:

![Image of the if-statement syntax: if(test) {body (statement to be executed)}.](images/if-statement-code.png)

1. The **test** â€“ this is what enables us to determine in what cases we execute the body and in what cases we don't. 

As mentioned previously, we want to write the test in such a way (using operators, *which we will mention in the next section of the reading*) that we relate some values and determine if the relationship is `true` or `false`. 

After the closing parenthesis of the test, we have the opening curly brace of the conditional.

2. The **body** (statements to be executed) â€“ if the test passes (evaluates to `true` ), then the body of statements in between the curly braces will be executed in the order they are written. 

After they are all executed, we will continue to execute the code that comes after the conditional (after the closing curly brace). 

If the test fails (evaluates to `false`), we will not execute the body. Rather, we will just execute the lines of code that come after the conditional. After the body of the conditional, the next line will contain the closing curly brace of the conditional.

The control flow for an `if` statement can be found below:

![Image of the control flow of the if-statement: if the conditional test is true, execute the controlled statement(s) inside the body of the if statement, then execute the statement after the conditional. If the conditional test is not true, execute the statement after the conditional.](images/if-statement-control-flow.png)

Recall the relational and logical operators that we can use to produce `boolean` expressions - we can use these within the tests of conditional statements!  

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 6;
        int num2 = 13;
        
        if (num1 > 0 && num2 > 0) {
            System.out.println("both numbers are positive");
        }

        num2 = -13;

        if (num1 > 0 || num2 > 0) {
            System.out.println("at least one of the numbers is positive!");
        }

        if (!(num2 > 0)) {
            System.out.println("the second number is negative!");
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸ’­  `if/else` statement

Building off the `if` statement, we have the `if/else` statement! This is a conditional structure that ends with an `else` branch, which allows us to execute a certain body of statements if a test evaluates `true`. If the test evaluates to `false`, then we execute the statements of the `else` branch. 

The `if/else` statement contains the following syntax:

![Image of the if/else statement syntax: if(test) { statement(s)} else { statement(s) }.](images/if-else-statement-code.png)

1. The **`if` branch** â€“ just like with a regular `if` statement, if the test in the `if` branch evaluates `true`, then we will execute the `if` branch (i.e. the statements in between the curly braces of the `if`). Once those statements are executed in the order they're written, we will execute the lines of code that come after the entire conditional structure, *meaning we do not execute the statements in the `else` branch*.

2. The **`else` branch** â€“ if the test in the `if` branch evaluates to `false`, then we will enter the `else` branch and execute the statements in that branch. Once those statements are executed in the order they're written, we will execute the lines of code that come after the entire conditional structure. 

With an `if/else` structure, we will enter exactly **one branch**. We will either execute the statements in the `if` branch OR the `else` branch, never both. 

Try running the code below to see how these `if/else` structures interact!

Try changing the values of `city` and `num` to see how the output changes!

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String city = "Seattle";
        int num = -5;
        
        if (city.equals("Manila")) {
            System.out.println("Mabuhay!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Hello!");
        }

        if (num < 0) {
            System.out.println("This number is less than 0");
        } else {
            System.out.println("This number is greater than 0");
        }
    }
}
```

The control flow for an `if/else` statement can be found below:

![Image of the control flow of the if/else statement: if the conditional test is true, execute the controlled statement(s) inside the body of the if statement, then execute the statement after the conditional. If the conditional test is not true, execute the the controlled statement(s) inside the body of the else statement, then execute the statement after the conditional.](images/if-statement-control-flow.png)

## ðŸ’­  `if/else if` statement

Lastly, we have the `if/else if` structure! This structure allows us to not only execute different bodies of statements depending on a test, but also allows us to evaluate multiple tests! How would we use such a structure in a real-life scenario?

Say that I was writing a method that would print one message if Person 1 won the race and would print a different message if Person 2 won the race. If there was a tie, I wouldn't want to print anything at all! In this case, we would only want to execute some code in two specific situations!


The `if/else if` statement contains the following syntax:

![Image of the if/else if statement syntax: if(test) { statement(s)} else if (tests) { statement(s) }.](images/if-else-if-code.png)

1. The **`if` branch** â€“ just like with a regular `if` statement, if the test in the `if` branch evaluates to true, then we will execute the `if` branch. Once those statements are executed in the order they're written, we will execute the lines of code that come after the entire conditional structure, *meaning we do not execute the statements in the `else if` branch*.

2. The **`else if` branch** â€“ if the test in the `if` branch evaluates to `false`, then we will evaluate the test in the `else if` branch. 

If that test evaluates `true`, then we will execute the statements in the `else if` branch. If that test evaluates to `false`, then we will execute the lines of code that come after the entire conditional structure, meaning we do not execute the statements in the `else if` branch.

With an `if/else if` structure, it's possible that we enter **one branch** or **none of the branches**. If it is the case that both of the tests evaluate `false`, then we will not execute any of the branches in the structure.

Try changing the values of `rank` and `coffeeOrder` and see how the output changes! Are there some values for each where we don't print any output at all?
:::

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int rank = 4;
        String coffeeOrder = "mocha";
        
        if (rank == 1) {
            System.out.println("WOOHOO! Gold medal!");
        } else if (rank == 2) {
            System.out.println("SILVER MEDAL! YAY!");
        } else if (rank == 3) {
            System.out.println("Bronze medal! Let's GO!");
        }

        if (coffeeOrder.equals("cold brew")) {
            System.out.println("pouring a cold brew!");
        } else if (coffeeOrder.equals("mocha")) {
            System.out.println("whipping up a mocha!");
        }
        
    }
}
```

The control flow for an `if/else if` statement can be found below:

![Image of the control flow of the if/else if statement: if test 1 is true, execute the controlled statement(s) inside the body of the if statement, then execute the statement after the conditional. If the test 1 is not true and test 2 is true, execute the the controlled statement(s) inside the body of the else if statement, then execute the statement after the conditional. If test 1 and test 2 are not true, execute the statement after the conditional.](images/if-else-if-control-flow.png)

If test 1 is **true**, then we execute statement(s) 1 and execute the statement(s) after the **conditional structure**. If test 1 is **false**, then we check if test 2 is **true**. If test 2 is **true**, we execute statement(s) 2 and execute the statement(s) after the conditional structure. If test 2 is **false**, we just execute the statement(s) after the conditional structure.

## ðŸ”Ž  Writing Multiple Branches

When we write conditional structures, we're not limited to just having two branches! With the introduction of the `else if` branch, we are able to check as many tests as we'd like (meaning we can add as many branches as needed). Note that with a conditional structure with multiple branches, we end with either an `else if` branch or an `else` branch. (*We'll come back to this idea in our next reading!*)

Check out an example of a conditional structure with multiple branches below:
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dayOfWeek = "Wednesday";

        if (dayOfWeek.equals("Monday")) {
            System.out.println("Beginning of the week! :)");
        } else if (dayOfWeek.equals("Wednesday")) {
            System.out.println("Hump day! XD");
        } else if (dayOfWeek.equals("Saturday") || dayOfWeek.equals("Sunday")) {
            System.out.println("The weekend! WOOHOO!");
        } else if (dayOfWeek.equals("Friday")) {
            System.out.println("Almost the weekend :D");
        } else {
            System.out.println("How many days until Friday? -_-");
        }

    }
}
```
:::{note}
Try changing `dayOfWeek` to some other day of the week to see how the output changes!

## Main Points:
- Conditionals allow us to execute some sequence of code if a condition is true, and to skip over that code otherwise.
- Conditionals give us control over our program so that some code only executes when we want it to.
- We learned about three different types of conditional branches
    * `if statement`: If the statement within the parenthesis is **true** (e.g. `if (x > 5)`), then the code that is within the `if` branch will execute.
    * `if/else statement`: If the statement within the parenthesis is **true** (e.g. `if (x > 5)`), then the code that is within the `if` branch will execute, otherwise the code that is within the `else` branch will execute (code must execute within either the `if` or `else` branch and the program will not skip over this code).
    * `if/else if statement`: If the statement within the first `if` statement is **false**, the program will move on to each `else if` branches that all contain different expressions (e.g. `if (x > 5) {} else if (x > 2) {} else if (x > 0){}`) until it finds a branch that evaluates to **true**. 
        * With `if/else if statements`, there is no requirement for any branch to evaluate to true, so there is no branch that must execute (unless the `if/else if statements` end with an `else` branch, in which case the code within the `else` branch will execute).
- We can combine many different conditional branches throughout our code!
