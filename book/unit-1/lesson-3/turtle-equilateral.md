# Turtle Equilateral

Write a Java program to draw a triangle using a Turtle. The triangle can be of any size and color you choose, but the triangle must be equilateral (i.e. each side must be the same length, where the angle between each side is 60 degrees).

**Hint**

If the inner angle of the triangle needs to be 60 degrees, we want to turn 120 degrees to create that angle (Because 180 - 120 = 60).
