# Matrix Add [2D Arrays Programming]

`Download starter code`

Write a method named `matrixAdd` that accepts a pair of two-dimensional arrays of integers as parameters, treats the arrays as 2D matrices and adds them, returning the result. The sum of two matrices A and B is a matrix C where for every row $i$ and column $j$, $C_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}$. You may assume that the arrays passed as parameters have the same dimensions and both arrays are non-null and *rectangular* (meaning that every row has the same number of elements).
