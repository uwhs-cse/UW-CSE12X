Above, you'll see there's a video titled **CSE 121: Array Basics & Traversal Pattern Video Walkthrough**. The video and the reading both have the same information! You're not required to go through both the video and the reading, as the video just walks through the reading to help contextualize it!
:::

It's time to introduce you to your first data structure!  We've been dealing with variables for several weeks now, which our first way of storing data or information.  Now, we're going to learn about **arrays** which will be able to store *even more* data than variables could!  



## üì¶ Picture this!

When we first introduced variables, we suggested you think about **variables as boxes** with: 

1. a name

2. a specific shape and size to be able to hold a *specific type*

3. the ability to hold a piece of data

Picture something like this:

![The text "int num = 10;" above a grey box with a 10 inside, with the label "name: num (int)" underneath.](images/variable.png)

Well, **arrays** sort of act like a bunch of variables that have been glued together... so we like to think of **arrays as cubbies**.  These cubbies have:

1. a name

2. a *specific length* (number of compartments)

3. a *specific type* that each of its compartments can hold

4. compartments where each compartment has:

  1. an *index* (like `String` indexes, starting at index 0)

  2. the ability to hold a piece of data

We'd suggest something like this picture:

![The text "int[] arr = new int[4];" above a grey box with the label "name: arr (int[])" underneath it. There is an arrow coming out the grey box and pointing to a row of 4 blue boxes, with 0's in each one and numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 underneath the boxes in order from left to right.](images/array.png)

Don't worry, we'll talk about the syntax in a moment.  But before we get there...



## üìÑ Some Basics

There are a few things you have to keep in mind when working with arrays.  

- The values that you can store inside of an array are referred to as **elements** of the array.  In the array shown above, all of the elements in the array `arr` have a value equal to 0. 

- Each compartment in the array has an **index** that refers to its position. Remember that programmers like to start counting at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on (the indices are listed underneath the array in the diagram above). 

- Arrays can only hold values that share the same type. In the example above, `arr` is an array that holds all `int` values. If we tried to put something like the `String` `"hello"` or the `double` `3.14159` into it, Java would complain (with a compiler error). 

- We have to specify how many elements we want the array to be able to hold (or its "length") when we first create it.  In the example above, the `4` on the right hand side of the assignment operator dictates that `arr` with have space for 4 elements. 



## üèóÔ∏è Array Creation

Take a closer look at the line of code to create an array that we had in the diagram above, and examine each of its parts.  

![TODO MISSING ALT TEXT](images/array-creation.png)

- The **type** - Just like any other variable, we first list the *type* of value it can hold. In this case, we are creating a variable that can store an *array of integers*.  

- The **name** - Again, just like other variables we need to give our variable a name: in this case, `arr`.  

- The **array creation code** - There are a few things to point out here. Notice that we're using the keyword `new` that we've for creating different kinds of objects (e.g. Random, File, Scanner) before‚Äîit turns out arrays are objects too! We then repeat the type of the array (`int[]`) but list the *length* of the array (or number of compartments) we are creating between the square brackets (`[]`).  



### üèÉ "Quick Initialization" Syntax

When you create an array using the syntax above, all of the elements are initialized to their "default values."  This default value depends on the type: 

- for `int`s, `0`

- for `double`s, `0.0`

- for `boolean`s, `false`

- for `String`s (and other objects), `null` (more to come on this later!)

For many cases, this is exactly what you want!  However, if you instead want to create an array and immediately store specific values, you can do that with a special "quick initialization" syntax where you put the values you want the array to hold inside of curly braces (`{}`).  For example, 

``` Java
import java.util.*;

public class ArrayInitialization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean[] arr1 = new boolean[4]; // [false, false, false, false]
        boolean[] arr2 = {false, true, true, false}; // [false, true, true, false]
    }
}
```


## üß∞ Working with Arrays

When working with arrays, it's helpful to remember that they're like a bunch of variables glued together. So dealing with an element at a specific index of the array is similar to how you would deal with an individual variable!  Below you can see a comparison of how you might work with a variable (in declarations, assignment statements, increments, and in expressions) and how you might similarly work with a specific index of an array. 

![two side-by-side pages, the left page with a heading "int" followed by "int num = 10;", "num = 14", "num++;", and "int x = num * 2;". The right page has heading "int[]" followed by "int[] arr = new int[4];", "arr[2] = 14;", "arr[2]++;", and "int y = arr[2] + 3;"](images/array-vs-variable.png)



## üìè Length

One additional thing that you can ask about an array is its length, or how many elements it has space for. You can do this with `<name of array>.length`.  Notice that there are no parentheses after "`length`" -- this is because `length` isn't a method, it's something called a **field**, or instance variable.  For now you can think of fields as data or values that a particular object keeps track of, and we'll dig more into this concept in CSE 122!  Take a look below for an example of asking for an array's length. 

``` Java
public class ArrayLength {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] temps = {68.0, 74.3, 79.16, 82.5};
        // get the length of array temps with temps.length
        System.out.println("the length of the temps array is: " + temps.length);
    }
}
```



## üñ®Ô∏è Printing Arrays

You may have noticed that, in all of the examples above, we never print out an array!  Let's take a look at what happens if we try the program below...

``` Java
public class PrintArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double[] temps = {68.0, 74.3, 79.16, 82.5};
        System.out.println("the length of the temps array is: " + temps.length);
        System.out.println("temps array contents: " + temps);
    }
}
```

You probably found that the output from this program was not what we were hoping for! Unfortunately we get this type of jumbled output when we try to print out arrays directly (it turns out it's not complete gibberish, but it's not incredibly helpful for our general purposes), but there *is* a way to print arrays out more nicely! Java has an `Arrays` utility (in the `java.util` package) class that provides a nice library of helpful methods that we can use with arrays. One of the most helpful methods in this library is the `Arrays.toString()` method!  Try modifying the code above by: 

- Adding `import java.util.*;` at the top of the program (which is where the `Arrays` class is located)

- Replacing line 5 in the code above with 

``` Java
System.out.println("temps array contents: " + Arrays.toString(temps));
```

and hit Run again!  You should see some more helpful output :)
